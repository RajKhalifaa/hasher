# hasher
This code allows the user to enter a string and then generates and prints the hash values of that string using five different hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, and SHA-512). Hashing is used to ensure data integrity, by transforming the original string into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a digest that uniquely identifies the input data.
